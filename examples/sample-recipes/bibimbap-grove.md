## Notes ![🍚+🔥](emojikitchen/1f35a_1f525.png)

"Bibimbap" means "mixed rice." The key is having everything at the right temperature - warm rice, hot vegetables and meat, and a runny egg that coats everything when mixed. Traditionally served in a hot stone bowl (dolsot) that creates a crispy rice crust.
