# Spaghetti Carbonara

Authentic Roman pasta dish with eggs, cheese, and guanciale.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb spaghetti
- 6 oz guanciale or pancetta, diced
- 4 large egg yolks
- 1 whole egg
- 1 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, grated
- Black pepper, freshly ground
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente.
2. While pasta cooks, render guanciale in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.
3. In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks, whole egg, and Pecorino Romano cheese. Add generous black pepper.
4. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain pasta.
5. Remove skillet from heat. Add hot pasta to the guanciale and toss.
6. Add egg mixture and quickly toss, adding pasta water as needed to create a creamy sauce.
7. Serve immediately with extra Pecorino and black pepper.

## Tips

The key is to work quickly and off heat to prevent the eggs from scrambling. The residual heat from the pasta and pan will cook the eggs to perfection.
