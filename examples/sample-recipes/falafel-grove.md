## Tips ![💡+⭐](emojikitchen/1f4a1_2b50.png)

**Critical:** Use dried chickpeas that have been soaked, NOT canned. Canned chickpeas have too much moisture and will make soggy falafel. The mixture should hold together when squeezed but still be slightly crumbly.

## Tahini Sauce

Mix 1/2 cup tahini, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 2 cloves minced garlic, and water to thin. Season with salt.
